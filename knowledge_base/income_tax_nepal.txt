Income Tax (आयकर) is a tax levied on the net profit made by a business during a fiscal year in Nepal. The fiscal year in Nepal runs from Shrawan 1st to the end of Ashadh (mid-July to mid-July).

For small businesses operating as a Sole Proprietorship, Nepal has a system called Presumptive Tax (अनुमानित कर). This simplifies tax filing greatly. If your annual turnover is below NPR 3 million (तीस लाख रुपैयाँ), you may be eligible to pay a flat, fixed amount of tax instead of calculating complex profits.

As per the budget for fiscal year 2080/81, the presumptive tax rates are based on turnover and location. For example, a business in a metropolitan city with a turnover between NPR 2 to 3 million pays a flat tax of NPR 7,500 for the year. The rates are lower for smaller municipalities and rural areas.

Private Limited Companies are required to pay a flat corporate income tax on their net profits. The standard rate of corporate income tax in Nepal is 25%. However, special economic zones or specific industries may have different, preferential rates.

Tax payments in Nepal are typically made in three installments. The first installment (40% of estimated annual tax) is due by the end of Poush (पौष मसान्त). The second installment (an additional 30%) is due by the end of Chaitra (चैत्र मसान्त), and the final installment (the remaining 30%) is due by the end of Ashadh (अषाढ मसान्त).
