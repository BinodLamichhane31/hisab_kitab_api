In Nepal, a business can be registered in several forms. For small business owners, the two most common types are Sole Proprietorship (एकलौटी फर्म) and Private Limited Company (प्राइभेट लिमिटेड कम्पनी).

A Sole Proprietorship is the simplest form, owned and run by one individual. It is easier and cheaper to register but the owner is personally liable for all business debts. It is registered at the local Department of Commerce, Supplies & Consumer Protection office.

A Private Limited Company is a separate legal entity from its owners. This means the owner's personal assets are protected from business debts. It can have from 1 to 101 shareholders. This type of company is registered at the Office of the Company Registrar (OCR).

To register a Private Limited Company, you will generally need the following documents: an application form, Memorandum of Association (Prabandha Patra), Articles of Association (Niyamawali), and citizenship copies of all founders (shareholders).

The official government body for company registration is the Office of the Company Registrar. For detailed forms and processes, you can visit their official website: https://ocr.gov.np/
